    <p class="text1"> Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
        in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
        to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
        severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
        and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
        discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. </p>
    <p class="text1"> People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
        disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
        the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
        coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
        around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
        these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
        People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
        person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
        why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
        person who is sick</p>

    <p class="text"> The cases in Maharashtra are high in both recovery and deaths. It indicates that either there was a delay in testing for COVID-19 due to which cases could not be controlled or there have been other comorbidities attached with the patients.  Kerala has lower deaths and higher recovery which means it has shown good record in controlling the cases and has provided good medical healthcare support. States with lesser number of both recovery and deaths are having cases only in recent times and evaluation after a few days will be able to clear the air about their condition. </p>

    <p class="text">It is important to have a look at the demographic information of the population affected by COVID19 so that the target population can be identified. Contrary to other countries, the number of cases below 40 years of are considerbaly higher. Which means that youngsters are equally susceptible to the virus. This can be explained by demography of India which a young nation and most population is below 40 years of age.</p>
    
    <h2 class="table-heading"><u>Sex wise distribution of COVID 19 patients</u></h2>
    <div class="plots">
        {{maleFemale | safe}}
    </div>
    <p class="text"> Taking a look at the sex based patient data, it appears that male are at higher risks of being infected and this can be explained by their greater movements and social interactions. Data shows that 70% patients are men while 30% are women</p>

    <h2 class="table-heading"><u>ICMR testing data</u></h2>
    <div class="plots">
        {{icmr_data | safe}}
    </div>
    <p class="text">Testing by ICMR was low in numbers initially. However, with the availability of more test kits, more samples are being tested and ICMR has a target to test 1 lakh samples everyday. With lockdown in place, extensive testing will go a long way in controlling the transmission rate of infection. Alongside, more tests will help to mark infected people and quarantine them. It will also help in identifying hotspot areas which are more prone to infection</p>
